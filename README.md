Conclusion Analysis
School performance is often assessed by looking at various metrics. Among these, the type of school, subject performance, and spending per student stand out. This report provides an overview of these three areas based on provided data.

Type of School: There exists a notable difference between Charter and District schools. Specifically, Charter schools such as Cabrera and Thomas witness a high pass rate of approximately 90%. In contrast, District schools, exemplified by Rodriguez, have a significantly lower pass rate of about 53%.

Reading vs. Math Performance: Across the board, students tend to excel more in reading than in math. On average, reading scores are around 80 points, while math scores lag slightly behind at roughly 77 points.

Spending and Results: An intriguing observation is that more spending per student does not necessarily equate to better academic outcomes. For instance, Cabrera school, with a spending of less than $585 per student, boasts a pass rate near 90%. Conversely, Huang school, despite spending more, sees only 53% of its students passing.

While school spending is essential, it doesn't guarantee high performance. The type of school and its inherent practices can significantly influence student success, as can be seen with the distinction between Charter and District schools. Additionally, the collective strength in reading over math suggests areas that might need more focused educational strategies.
